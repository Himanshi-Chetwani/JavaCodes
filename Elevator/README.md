Convert your elevator program from the previous weekâ€™s assignment to use lambdas where appropriate. You should also add a method name elevatorAndPersonSummary which you will call after all threads have started which uses a pipeline, or sequence of aggregate operations, to display even numbered people statistics and whether or not they are on an elevator.  
An output of the method should follow the below format

Person2 
Weight: <weight>
Status: <on/off>
	# if on elevator
	Weight Contribution: <percent contribution of weight to current weight on elevator>
Person4 
Weight: <weight>
Status: <on/off>
	# if on elevator
	Weight Contribution: <percent contribution of weight to current weight on elevator>
