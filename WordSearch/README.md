You program should prompt the user for an input file that will contain the word search puzzle. You program should then present that puzzle to the user and ask which word to search for. Your search should be able to find a word horizontally, vertically, and diagonally both forwards and backwards. 

If the file entered by the user is not present, you must inform the user and prompt again. If the user enters “exit” at this prompt, the program should exit with code 1. 

After your program displays the puzzle to the user, it should prompt for a word to search, if “exit” is entered, your program should exit with code 2. Otherwise, your program should search for the word and display where it found the word. If the word is not present, it should tell the user.

You can assume that your word search puzzle is n x n.
